        <h2 style="color: var(--black); font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">   “When Andrew Knowlton Visited Fruits Island: A Juicy Encounter with Perfection”</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--light-color);">
            There are days that go down in the history of a business — days when something magical happens. For Fruits Island, that day came when world-renowned food critic Andrew Knowlton stepped into our juice shop, unannounced, curious, and thirsty for something extraordinary.<br>
            From the moment he walked through the door, there was a buzz. Our team, always passionate but now even more eager to impress, served up a curated tasting menu of our finest juices — cold-pressed classics, exotic fruit blends, and our signature island-style cocktails.<br>

            First came the Tropical Sunrise, a vibrant mix of mango, passionfruit, and a hint of fresh lime. Andrew's eyes lit up at the first sip. “Bright, refreshing, and balanced — this is sunshine in a cup,” he remarked.<br>

            Then came the Berry Breeze, a mix of strawberries, blueberries, and acai. “It tastes real,” he said. “Like someone bottled the feeling of picking berries in the summer.”<br>

            But the moment that sealed it? Our Fruits Island Signature Cocktail — a layered fusion of watermelon, kiwi, pineapple, and mint, poured with precision and care. Andrew simply paused, smiled, and said:<br>

            “This isn’t just juice. It’s a story told in flavors.”<br>

            He left us with kind words and a promise to return.<br>
            We were honored. We were inspired. And we were reminded of why we started Fruits Island in the first place — to bring honest, fresh, unforgettable juice to every glass.<br>
